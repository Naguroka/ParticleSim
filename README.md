# Particle Simulation Project

## Overview
This project is a graphical particle simulation developed in Python using the `tkinter` library. It features a dynamic particle system where particles interact with user input and environmental factors like gravity. Users can customize particle behavior and appearance, creating a visually engaging experience.

## Features
- Particle creation and movement.
- Interactive control with mouse input.
- Customizable particle size and color.
- Simulation of gravitational effects.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

## Installation
No installation is required. Simply clone the repository or download the `main.py` file.

## Usage
Run the `main.py` file in a Python environment: 

```python main.py```

Interact with the simulation using mouse movements and clicks to influence particle behavior.

## Project Status
This is a completed project with no future updates planned.
